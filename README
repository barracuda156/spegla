SPEGLA 1.1

Spegla is a mirror program for FTP sites.

Spegla was written because I couldn't find any fast mirroring
program for big mirrors. It makes a complete mirror of a FTP area.


COMPILE:

If you compile under Free/Net/OpenBSD make should do it. If you
compile under some other OS you have to do:
"make -f Makefile.<your system>"
where <your system> can be one of linux, solaris or ultrix.  If it
doesn't compile anyway I have probably forgot to update the makefile
for that system. There are other makefiles too but they have not been
updated since last version of spegla and will not work.

If youre OS isn't listed above you need to hack a bit. When it
works, I would be gratefull if you mail me the changes and the
makefile so I can include it.

The program was initially developed under NetBSD 1.3 and tested on
a Digital VAX 11/785 running NetBSD 1.3. The continued development
has been done primary on a Digital AlphaPC 164SX running NetBSD
1.4.  It should work on the other OS:es to, but if it doesn't please
tell me.


USAGE:

Consult the nice manpage.
